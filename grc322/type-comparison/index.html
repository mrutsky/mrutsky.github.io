        <h1>Futura vs. Mr Eaves Mod </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Futura</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Futura was first invented by Paul Renner in Germany in the 1920’s. The font was associated with the New Typography movement, which included asymmetric balance, content hierarchy, white space utilization, and sans serif style choices. This font has some political history, given that Renner was outwardly anti-Nazi, and this led to his arrest and relocation to Switzerland. The Nazis rejected modern typefaces like Futura in favor of more traditional blackletter styles, so Futura was looked at as “degenerate art.” Once Futura was utilized in graphs, charts, comics, and print by the Allied Forces, it became recognized as a “perfect no-nonsense” font. Today, it’s been used by NASA, high end car brands, vodka bottles, hospitals, films, etc. It’s versatile, minimal, and all-encompassing.</p>
             
			 <h3>Mr Eaves Mod</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Mr Eaves was first invented by Zuzana Licko in 2009 after she designed the sans serif accompaniment, Mrs Eaves. Mrs Eaves was based on heavier, more character-filled samples that had spread ink than its predecessors like Baskerville. Mr Eaves Mod was designed to complement its serif counterpart, though it stands as its own unique typeface. Licko’s fear was developing something that looked like Mrs Eaves with the serifs chopped off. This version has less contrast and a more geometric letterform with symmetric lowercase counters, as well as increased white space. It is free of tails, and has been said to be the variant that has moved furthest from its roots.</p>
